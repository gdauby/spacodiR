This repository contains the R package spacodiR which was removed from CRAN.

Some functions were removed as they were not used or necessary for the key function `spacodi.calc` used to compute various metrics of phylogenetic/functional community structures.


All functions were written by JE Eastman, Tim CE Paine and OJ Hardy.

Computations of various statistics rely on C code also found in an executable software that can be found in the following link:

https://ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/SPACoDi.html  

The package can be installed by the following code

`install.packages("devtools")`
`devtools::install_github("gdauby/spacodiR")`
