This repository contains the R package spacodiR which was removed from
CRAN.

Some functions were removed as they were not used or necessary for the
key function `spacodi.calc` used to compute various metrics of
phylogenetic/functional community structures.

Functions were written by JE Eastman, Tim CE Paine, OJ Hardy, G Dauby.

Computations of various statistics rely on C code also found in an
executable software that can be found in the following link:

<https://ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/SPACoDi.html>

The package can be installed by the following code

`install.packages("devtools")`

`devtools::install_github("gdauby/spacodiR@main")`

# A new function for adding missing species to a phylogeny

In addition to the original package, **a new function** has been added
`add_species_to_genera` which allow adding species to a phylogeny if the
genus is present in the phylogeny.

``` r
data("subset_phy")
library(ape)

plot(subset_phy)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
species_to_match <- c("Dacryodes nitens", "Dacryodes kamerunensis", "Aucoumea gabonensis")

updated_phylo <- add_species_to_genera(specieslist = gsub(" ", "_", species_to_match), phy =  subset_phy)
```

    ## 1 species already present, 0 species without matching genus (not added), 2 species to add now to the tree:

``` r
plot(updated_phylo$phylo)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png)<!-- -->

By default the branch length given to the added species cannot be higher
than 20 But this can be changed with the argument
`threshold_upper_branch`.

``` r
updated_phylo <- add_species_to_genera(specieslist = gsub(" ", "_", species_to_match), phy =  subset_phy, threshold_upper_branch = 5)
```

    ## 1 species already present, 0 species without matching genus (not added), 2 species to add now to the tree:

``` r
plot(updated_phylo$phylo)
```
